Usage instructions for SmartQuotes

The script isn't entirely automated - some (most) occurrences of
the "smart quote" character should be replaced by apostrophes, but
not all.  Hence, human review is required.

1. Run the script with no arguments, and save the output to a file:

	./admin/cleanup/SmartQuotes > sq.txt

2. Edit the file you just created, and delete occurrences you *don't*
want fixed.  The script output looks a bit like this:

           1  ve´ron
           6  i´m
          17  you´re

The number on the left is the number of times the word on the right
was seen.  In this case "I'm" and "You're" should be fixed, so leave
them in the file; "Ve´ron" shouldn't be fixed, so delete that line.
Then, save the file.

3. Re-run the SmartQuotes script, passing the name of the file you just
   saved like so:

	./admin/reports/SmartQuotes.pl --fixfile=sq.txt

The script should now do just as before, but whenever it finds a word
which was in the file you gave it (i.e. where you've indicated it should
be fixed), a moderation will be entered to fix the data.

4. That's it!

NOTES

Artist aliases need deleting and re-adding, since there is no "edit artist
alias" moderation currently.  However, since "delete artist alias" is not
automodded, this action is not immediate, it will need to be voted on.

Existing moderations are ignored; thus if the data they are for is changed
by this script, those moderations will most like fail their prerequisites.

Use "SmartQuotes --help" to see other options, such as selecting which
moderator to use.
