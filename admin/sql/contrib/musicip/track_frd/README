MusicIP track first release date extension
==========================================

(C) Copyright 2006 MusicIP

Intro:
------

These SQL scripts extend the MusicBrainz database so that the first release 
date is available for each track. These scripts should run on all different
MusicBrainz server installs (MASTER, SLAVE, STANDALONE). These scripts create
a new table called track_firstreleasedate and maintain this table through
adding a number of new functions and triggers.

Package contents:
-----------------

The files included in this package are:

CreateTrackDateFunctions.sql:
   This SQL script creates the underlying stored procedures that 
   maintain the track_firstreleasedate table.
                               
DropTrackDateFunctions.sql:
   Drop the functions created by the CreateTrackDateFunctions.sql script.

CreateTrackDateTriggers.sql:
   Creates the triggers that call the stored procedures.

DropTrackDateTriggers.sql
   Drop the triggers created by CreateTrackDateTriggers.sql.

PopulateTrackDates.sql:
   Create the track_firstreleasedate table and populate the table.

Usage:
------

Each of these scripts is designed to execute by redirecting the
script into the psql script in the /admin directory. For instance:

   (path to mb install)/admin/psql READWRITE < CreateTrackDateFunctions.sql

executes the CreateTrackDateFunctions.sql script.

To prepare for installation, turn off cron jobs so they cannot
interfere with installing this extension.

Then, to install this extension, execute scripts in this order:

psql READWRITE < CreateTrackDateFunctions.sql
psql READWRITE < PopulateTrackDates.sql
psql READWRITE < CreateTrackDateTriggers.sql

Once these scripts have finished executing, then re-enable the cron
jobs and you're done!

If in the future you want to undo these changes, run these scripts
(with cron disabled again):

psql READWRITE < DropTrackDateTriggers.sql
psql READWRITE < DropTrackDateFunctions.sql
echo "drop table track_firstreleasedate;" | psql READWRITE
