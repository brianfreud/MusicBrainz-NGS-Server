Installing mb_server
--------------------

mb_server is the web front end to the MusicBrainz data (as displayed at
http://musicbrainz.org/), and this document explains how you can get everything
up and running.

We've tried to make installation as painless as possible, but first - a few
prerequisites:

Prequisites
-----------

1)	Perl 5.8.0

	Perl 5.8.0 (minimum) is required. You can use Perl 5.10.0, but be aware that it
	has some quirks in handling subroutine attributes, which can make debugging
	difficult in a few cases.
	
	You can check your installed version of Perl with:
	
	    perl -v
	
2)  Postgres 8.2

    This is to set up the MusicBrainz database

Getting going
-------------

1) Make a checkout of the code.

    svn co http://svn.musicbrainz.org/mb_server/branches/TemplateToolkit mb_server-tt
	
2) Configure the server

	cd mb_server-tt
	cp lib/DBDefs.pm.default lib/DBDefs.pm
	cp lib/MusicBrainz/Server.pm.default lib/MusicBrainz/Server.pm
	
	Edit the newly copied DBDefs.pm as need be. For the most part, it should be
	fine to use as is. Refer to INSTALL for more indepth info about this, and 
    how it ties in with running a copy of the MusicBrainz database.
    
    You can also edit the new Server.pm. This is mostly for server admins,
    however - who require different stores for sessions, more control
    over Debug output - etc. Developers will be OK to leave this as is.
	
3) Install prerequisite Perl modules

    The Module::Install module reads a file called Makefile.PL to create a standard
    Makefile. This Makefile can then be used to install dependant Perl modules. First,
    make sure you have inc-Module-Install on your system:

        perl -MCPAN -e 'install Module::Install'
            
    Now, build the Makefile, and install dependancies (if necessary)
    
        perl ./Makefile.PL
        sudo make installdeps

        This will generate a standard Makefile, which you can use to install dependancies:

4) Create the databases

	You have 2 options when it comes to databases. You can either opt for a clean database,
	with just the schema (useful for developers with little free diskspace), or you can use
	a copy of the MusicBrainz data.
	
	a) Using Clean Databases
	
		To use clean databases, all you need to do is run:
		
			./admin/InitDb.pl --createdb --clean
		
	b) Using Database Dumps
	
		MusicBrainz frequently do full dumps of the database, which you can import to your own
		local database. This is the best option for long term developers. The database dumps are
		stored at
		
			ftp://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/data/fullexport
		
		To get going, all you need is the mbdump.tar.bz2 archive, but you can grab whichever dumps
		suit your needs. Assuming the dumps have been downloaded to `/tmp/dumps/' you can then
		import with:
		
			./admin/InitDb.pl --createdb --import /tmp/dumps/mbdump*.tar.bz2 --echo
			
		--echo just gives us a bit more feedback, in case this goes wrong - you can leave it off.
		Remember to change the paths to your mbdump*.tar.bz2 files, if they are not in /tmp/dumps/.

5) Load WikiDocs transclusion file (optional)

	If you would like to have the /doc pages load properly on a RT_STANDALONE installation, follow 
	these steps:

               cd <mb_server-tt>
               mkdir cd root/static/wikidocs
	       cd root/static/wikidocs
	       curl http://musicbrainz.org/generated/wikitrans-index > index.txt

	After this, the documentation index should be loadable.

6) Start the development server

	You should now have everything ready to run the development server! The development server is
	a lightweight HTTP server, that gives good debug output, and is much more convenient than having
	to set up a full blown stack. Just run:

		./script/musicbrainz_server.pl -r
	
	Visiting http://your.machines.ip.address:3000 should now present you with the mb_server frontend.

If, however, this *doesn't* happen - please contact aCiD2 on IRC, or file a bug at
http://bugs.musicbrainz.org.

Good luck, and happy hacking!
