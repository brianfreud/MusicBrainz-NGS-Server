        Non-album tracks are designed for <strong>tracks that have not been released
        on ANY [%- doc_link("Release", "release") -%]</strong>

    <li>
        Demo tracks and promotional tracks that have never been released on a release
        are good candidates for non-album tracks.

    <li>
        Most live versions are released on singles. If you want to enter those tracks
        into MusicBrainz, please enter them as the single release, or import them
        from [%- doc_link("FreeDB", "FreeDB") -%], instead of adding them as
        [%- doc_link("NonAlbumTrack", "non-album tracks") -%].
    </li>
    <li>
        To enter a non-album track you must provide an
        [%- doc_link("EditNote", "edit note") -%]
        that lets the voters know why you think this is a
        [%- doc_link("NonAlbumTrack", "non-album track") -%].
        You are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to include a URL that will allow
        the voters to evaluate the correctness of this edit.
