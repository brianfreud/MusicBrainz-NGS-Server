        MusicBrainz uses artist aliases mainly as variant names or search hints.

    <li>
        If you see a misspelled alias here, it's most likely listed on purpose and
        should not be renamed.  See the documentation about
        [%- doc_link('ArtistAlias', 'artist aliases') -%]
        for more details.
    </li>
    <li>
        Please note that aliases are currently <strong>required to be unique
        for all artists</strong>. You can circumvent this limitation by adding
        a comment to the alias, preferably in parentheses.
