Testing
-------

We use standard Perl tools for unit testing. Tests are located in the t/
directory. The preferred way to run them is to use the `prove` program from
Test::Harness. For example, to run all tests use:

 $ prove -l t/
 
Or if you want to run only specific tests:

 $ prove -l t/entity_artist.t
 $ prove -l t/entity*.t
